## THIS CODE CURRENTLY DOES NOT COMPILE! DONT DO ISSUES ABOUT MISSING IMPLEMENTATIONS!

A vanilla-near world generator for pocketmine-mp v5. Keep in mind that this project is still under development and is not fully optimized, but further improvements are planned.
This project is based on the NetherGamesMC ext-vanillagenerator implementation.*

### Why?
Because I saw a lot of small servers switching away from pocketmine-mp even if the software is great, because of the lack of vanilla feature implementation.
I want to provide an easy to use solution for all people using pocketmine-mp, by adding a vanilla-like world without the need to rebuild binarys and modifing pocketmine-mp internals.
All of this should lower the entry barrier to pocketmine-mp and retain the old community and allow more vanilla-like gamemode being implemented using pocketmine-mp. 

  *This project contains code that is based of the code of the NetherGamesMC ext-vanillagenerator, served under MIT, just like this project.
